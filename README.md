# cryptographer
CRYPTOGRAPHY IS THE PRACTICE AND STUDY OF TECHNIQUES FOR SECURE COMMUNICATION IN THE PRESENCE OF THIRD PARTIES.
Cryptographer was designed with different interfaces used for conversion of data in format such as .txt, .doc to a ciphertext using a unique key, which could be used to retrieve the original data back using decrypt mechanism. 
THE PROJECT WAS IMPLEMENTED USING:-
Java GUI widget toolkit called swings.
Login page was developed to help user choose the operation to be carried out i.e encrypt or decrypt.
Encrypt and decrypt page would contain holders for the files(text,doc) to be encrypted or decrypted ,password(key) and the new file path.
